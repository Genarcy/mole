            Mole Day is celebrated annually on October 23rd by chemists and chemistry enthusiasts worldwide. 
            The date (10/23) represents Avogadro's number, which is approximately 6.022 x 10<sup>23</sup>. This number 
            is a fundamental constant in chemistry that defines the number of atoms, molecules, or particles 
            in one mole of a substance. The celebration helps raise awareness and appreciation of chemistry 
            and its importance in our daily lives.
